# Time Series Forecasting Shiny App

This is an Shiny App that highlights a few findings that I made when forecasting multiple timeseries with modeltime and tidymodels, two great packages for Time Series forecasting in R. The dataset used came from the tidymodels package and hopefully, this app and framework can be applied to other retail datasets.  

More developments real soon!
