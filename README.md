# Time Series Multiple Forecasting Shiny App

<img src="https://github.com/rafabelokurows/TimeSeriesForecastingApp/blob/master/forecasting.png">

For a live demo, hosted at shinyapps.io: [Time Series Multiple Forecasting](https://rafabelokurows.shinyapps.io/TimeSeriesPrediction/?_ga=2.257207563.1444425787.1641832992-1085722634.1641321539)

This is an Shiny App that highlights a few findings that I made when forecasting multiple timeseries with **modeltime** and **tidymodels**, two great packages for Time Series forecasting in R. The dataset used came from the tidymodels package and hopefully, this app and framework can be applied to other retail datasets.  

A brief summary of what you'll find here:

- Apply several ML and traditional time series forecasting methods (Random Forest, SVM, ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, and others)
- Showcase a quick way of communicating/evaluating results for each individual time series
- Aggregate predictions to simulate a retail company forecasting sales for many departmens, products, groups, etc.

Updates soon to come!

## Ideas for next versions:  

- Adding some more time series
- Using other sources of retail data
- Adding features
- Adding Deep Learning algorithms
